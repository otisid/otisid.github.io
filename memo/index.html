<p>If you got all the way through here, admire a picture of my animal companion while he was small and over 9000 cute:</p>
<img src="/sources/img/little_maxcat.png" title="Cute cat" alt="Here comes Max!">
<br>
<p>He is still and always be that cute, but now in some better place. May your food and water bowls always be full and your fur shiny, my friend (Max, 2011. - 2016.).</p>
